The scope of the first POC is quite limited:

  1 Target Systems are running with Ubuntu12.04 or 14.04
  1 Configured node targets should be
    1 classic hosted servers (with manual bootstrap)
    1 (for future outlook) VirtualBox Nodes (automaticaly bootstraped?)
    1 (for future outlook maybe) OpenStack Cloud Nodes (automatically bootstraped?)

For exchanging code, we can use https://github.com/DomainDrivenArchitecture/learning-pallet
