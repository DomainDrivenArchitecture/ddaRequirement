The scope of the first POC is quite limited:

  1. Target Systems are running with Ubuntu12.04, 14.04 or 16.04
  2. The following node target types should be configurable by dda-pallet
    1. existing hosted servers (dedicated / vms) over ssh.
    2. VirtualBox nodes
    3. Cloud Nodes - OpenStack or AWS
