The scope of the first POC is quite limited:

  1. Target Systems are running with Ubuntu12.04 or 14.04
  2. Configured node targets should be
    1. classic hosted servers (with manual bootstrap)
    2. (for future outlook) VirtualBox Nodes (automaticaly bootstraped?)
    3. (for future outlook maybe) OpenStack Cloud Nodes (automatically bootstraped?)
