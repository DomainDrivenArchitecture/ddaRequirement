My vision is, to be able to distribute configuration as code    
  1. to servers      
    1. my own ones,
    2. to my customers servers also
  2. to clients for people sitting all over the world
    1. my employees, doing a office job
    2. my developers, doing a software development job
    3. employees of my customers also

In order to gain a good acceptance, developers should be able, to change, review & pull their configuration in independent manner.

In order to reach a configuration framework being complete as possible, collaboration with others and therefore OpenSource is essential.
All common usable modules should be distributed under Apache2 License (maybe Eclipse License is also feasible).
