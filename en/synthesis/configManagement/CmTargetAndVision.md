The vision of dda-pallet is, to be able to spawn & operate infrastructure from code in a automated manner. Target system types are:    
  1. Applications servers for many tenants
  2. Desktop clients for employees sitting all over the world
    1. Employees, doing a office job
    2. DevOps, doing a software development job. In order to gain a good acceptance, DevOps should be able, to change, review & pull their configuration in independent manner.
  3. Configuration should be as easy as possible. So we will use tenant specific conventions 
  4. Collaboration is essential. In order to reach a configuration framework being complete as possible, collaboration with others and therefore OpenSource is necessary.
All common usable modules should be distributed under Apache2 License (maybe Eclipse License is also feasible).
